<h2>Eucalyptus</h2><img src="Eucalyptus.avif">
<p>Eucalyptus is a genus of more than 700 species of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. Most species of Eucalyptus are trees, often mallees, and a few are shrubs. The most readily recognisable characteristics of Eucalyptus species are the distinctive flowers and fruit (capsules or "gumnuts"). Flowers have numerous fluffy stamens which may be white, cream, yellow, pink, or red; in bud. Regular use of eucalyptus oil can not only reduce hair loss but also promote hair growth by nourishing the scalp and strands with nutrients important for healthy hair.
<h2>Uses:</h2>
 Many medicines to treat coughs and the common cold contain eucalyptus. It is found in many lozenges, cough syrups, rubs, and vapor baths throughout the United States and Europe. Herbalists often recommend using fresh leaves in gargles to soothe sore throats and treat bronchitis and sinusitis. Eucalyptus oil is rich in cineole, an antiseptic that kills the bacteria that can cause bad breath. Some antiseptic mouthwashes use eucalyptus along with other oils, and have been shown to help prevent plaque and gingivitis.</p>
