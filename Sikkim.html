<h2>Aeschynanthus sikkimensis</h2><img src="sunny.jpg">
<p>Aeschynanthus is a genus of about 150 species of evergreen subtropical and tropical plants in the family Gesneriaceae. They are usually trailing epiphytes with brightly colored flowers that are pollinated by sunbirds. The genus name comes from a contraction of aischuno (to be ashamed) and anthos (flower). The common name for some species is lipstick plant, which comes from the appearance of the developing buds emerging from the calyces. It is an epiphytic under shrub in the Gesneriaceae family that grows in Himalaya at an altitude of 5000- 7000ft above sea level in north east India, Nepal and Bhutan. They require good lighting and semi-moist, well-drained soil conditions to grow, though they vary and some require more moist soil. They also prefer warm and humid conditions.
<h2>Uses:</h2>
Rootstock leaves and flowers are widely used traditionally for fever, throat pain and tonsillitis. A detailed literature review on the plant under investigation has shown that so far, there are no published reports on the chemical components of Aeschynanthus sikkimensis (Clarke) Stapf. The presence  of  various  bioactive  compounds confirms  the  application  of  Aeschynanthus sikkimensis (Clarke)  Stapf  for various ailments  by traditional  practitioners.  However,  isolation  of individual  phytochemical  constituents  may proceed to find a novel drug. </p>
