    <h2>Acalypha indica</h2><img src="Acalypha indica.jpg">
<p>Acalypha indica (English: Indian scalypha, Indian mercury, Indian vopperleaf, Indian nettle, three-seeded mercury) is an herbaceous annual that has catkin-like inflorescences with cup-shaped involucres surrounding the minute flowers. It is mainly known for its root being attractive to domestic cats, and for its various medicinal uses. It occurs throughout the Tropics. This plant is held in high esteem in traditional Tamil Siddha medicine as it is believed to rejuvenate the body. The plant has also been eaten as a vegetable in Africa and India, but care needs when eating it since it contains several alkaloids as well
as hydrocyanic acid.
<h2>Uses:</h2>
The plant has many traditional medicinal uses. In Madagascar, the crushed plant is used for skin parasites. In Mauritius, the sap of crushed leaves mixed with salt, or a decoction of plant, is used for scabies and other skin problems. In the Seychelles and Réunion, a root infusion or decoction is taken for asthma, and also to clean the liver and kidneys. The root decoction is also taken for intestinal worms and stomach ache. The leaf sap is taken as an emetic. An infusion together with the roots of Tylophora indica is taken in Réunion as an emetic in the case of poisoning. A leaf infusion is also taken as a purgative and vermifuge in Réunion and Madagascar. In East Africa sap of the leaves is used for eye infections. Leaf powder is used for maggot-infested wounds. Acalypha indica is listed in the Pharmacopoeia of India as an expectorant to treat asthma and pneumonia.</p>
