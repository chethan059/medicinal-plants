<h2>Turmeric</h2><img src="turmeric.webp">
<p>Turmeric  or Curcuma longa  is a flowering plant in the ginger family Zingiberaceae. It is a perennial, rhizomatous, herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia that requires temperatures between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and high annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes, some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption. Turmeric is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes, imparting a mustard-like, earthy aroma and pungent, slightly bitter flavor to foods. Turmeric is approved for use as a food color, assigned the code E100. The oleoresin is used for oil-containing products.
<h2>Uses:</h2>
It is a medicinal plant extensively used in Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medicine as a home remedy for various diseases including biliary disorders, anorexia, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorders, rheumatism, and sinusitis. Turmeric might be helpful against tooth decay and is used in the preparation of toothpaste due to its potential antibiotic, astringent (causing the contraction of cells to reduce bleeding from minor abrasions) and anti-inflammatory activities. It might help against bacteria responsible for the development of cavities and may also help tone the gums. A variety of bacteria, disease-causing fungi, and parasites might be inhibited by turmeric extract and the essential oil of Curcuma longa. The aqueous extract of turmeric might exhibit antibacterial effects. The growth of several bacteria like staphylococcus, lactobacillus, and streptococcus might be suppressed by curcumin.</p>
