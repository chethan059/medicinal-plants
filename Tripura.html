        <h2>Marsilea minuta</h2><img src="Marsilea minuta.jpg">
        <p>Marsilea minuta, or dwarf waterclover is a species of aquatic fern in the family Marsileaceae.  In parts of India it can be called sunisanakka .In Indonesian it is semanggi (literally "clover"),but this name also applies to Marsilea crenata. In Japanese it is nangokudenjiso and in Thai it is phakwaen. It can grow in fresh water or brackish water in clay or sandy soil. The plant can develop into large colonies, and can be weedy. Some of its preferred habitat is being lost to agriculture but as it readily grows in Paddy fields, drainage ditches, and other marginal areas its overall population is stable. It has the potential to be invasive and dispersal through aquarium trade and other human means should be limited. 
        <h2>Uses:</h2>
        It is eaten in India, Sri Lanka, and in Bangladesh. In China it is used as forage. It has a raw protein content of 3.3%.The plant is used traditionally in China for edema, skin injuries, snakebite, and inflammation.[8] In Mymensingh District it is traditionally used to treat cough, headache, hypertension, sleep disorders, and respiratory diseases. It is combined with Nardostachys jatamansi and after development by Asima Chatterjee sold as an ayurvedic treatment for epilepsy called "Ayush-56." However, Ayush-56 does not show encouraging results in treating the disease.It is also used as a phytoremediator of arsenic while growing with rice plants. The leaves and shoots of the plant are commonly used as vegetable, and it finds extensive application in the treatment of cough and respiratory troubles. Juice of the fresh shoots and decoction of leaves are used to treat cough and other respiratory troubles by the people of India .</p>
